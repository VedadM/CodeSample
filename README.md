### Code Samples

1. Games Folder

Contains few smaller games I created. I will have to eventually updated it.

2. Sample Website

Minisite created for one of the clients. It was created with Vanilla Javascipt and few helper libraries.
Run it with ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 ```


3. HTML

Just a simple HTML Page created for a friend that wanted to learn more about flexbox.

4. Multi Answers

Quick survey based questionnaire for a client. I had no design or end point available, so it is a bit bland.

5. React, Redux and Flow (Plus few more react libraries)

I have included just few files from this project. This has more structure then other projects in this repo since it was much larger.
