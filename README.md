### Code Samples

1. Games Folder

Contains few smaller games I created. I will have to eventually convert it into newer JS code.

2. Sample Website

Minisite created for one of the clients. It was created with Vanilla Javascipt and few helper libraries.

3. HTML

Just a simple HTML Page created for a friend that wanted to learn more about flexbox.
